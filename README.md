   git clone https://github.com/<username>/customer-segmentation.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python customer_segmentation.py
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python).

## Output
